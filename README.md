In football there are various types of passes like curve(banana) shot, knuckle ball, trivela shot, etc. This project is based on the trajectory of ball in football. Since there are many types of passes in football, I will be focusing on the famous shot taken by Roberto Carlos against France in 1997. This goal has since become
legendary, not only for its spectacular nature but also because of the scientific
intrigue surrounding it.
The extraordinary curvature of the ball in Roberto Carlosâ€™ shot has be explained by the Magnus effect, a phenomenon in which a spinning ball creates a
pressure differential in the surrounding air, causing it to follow a curved path.
In his free kick, Carlos imparted substantial spin to the ball, which, combined
with its velocity, allowed it to bend sharply mid-flight, defying the expectations
of both the defenders and the goalkeeper.
